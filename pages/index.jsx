          startups and much more.<br></br>Apart from work, I particularly enjoy
          playing games, badminton, listening all genres of music, watching

          Lately, I have been sharing my views through social media, and blog
          posts. This website is a collection of my musings, the insights I've
          gained and still gaining that I want to share.
