          I am Harsh, and currently working as Full Stack Developer. This is my
          personal homepage. I love exploring, learning &amp; talking about
          coding, web development, app development, new technologies and much
          more.
          <br></br>Apart from work, I particularly enjoy playing games,
          badminton, listening all genres of music, watching movies, web series,
          listening to the podcasts, news and travelling.

          Lately, I have been sharing my views through social media, and blog
          posts. This website is a collection of my musings, the insights
          I&apos;ve gained and still gaining that I want to share.
